  :description: "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nwww.fieldofdreamsrescue.net
    Email; fieldofdreamsrescue1@gmail.com\n\n Cute as a button! She is a very loving
    little girl that just wants to know who she belongs to. Quiet and distant when
    she meets new people, warms up with a happy smile, tail wag and affection. Best
    suited as a companion to a woman, but could make a wonderful addition to family
    with gentle quiet children (currently fostered in a home with 5 kids) single,
    or active senior. Sadly, she was owner surrendered into the shelter because of
    allergies, we have no other history on her, great off leash, hasn't had any accidents,
    but we advise families taking any new dog home to act as if they are not housebroken.
    She has a super short soft coat that makes her very warm cuddly, she loves being
    fussed over. She enjoys quieter children and will prefer woman. Adoption donation
    $200, includes her spay, rabies, dhpp vaccine, bordatella vaccine, heartworm test,
    heartgard, frontline, microchip, worming, microchip and frontline.\n\n  \n\n Email
    From her foster home: \n\n Hi Melissa!\n\n  \n\n I've been meaning to send you
    an email, but all five kids got hit with the stomach flu, so it was crazy around
    here for a bit! Sweetie was so cute though.....cuddling with them and helping
    them feel better. She's doing great! She loves playing with our dog and they have
    become good buddies. She's eating well, playing hard, and getting lots of love
    and cuddles. When our kids are playing with our dog and Sweetie thinks our dog
    is getting too rough, Sweetie steps in and scolds her...it is so cute! I also
    plan on getting some pictures and video to you soon, now that we've all recovered!
    :)\n\n Hope you are doing well!\n\n  \n\n Take Care,\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  I
    just had to share this with you. Sassy loves all the kids but absolutely adores
    our three year old. Sassy will let her do anything!! Katelynn caries her around
    all day and sassy is never too far from her. There's a lot of love and patience
    in this sweet girl!   Take care,"

  :size: medium
  :description: "Introducing Wilmington and Larson â\x80\x93 a bonded mother and son
    pair.  Wilmington is the black and white one;  Larson is the fawn and white one.
    \  This pair is very attached to one another so we are looking for a forever home
    that can take them both.  A little history:  they were rescued from a high kill
    shelter in which the shelter planned on putting Mama (Wilmington) to sleep while
    placing her baby (Larson) up for adoption.  We couldnâ\x80\x99t let that happen.
    \ We took them in and have been so touched by the bond they share. Their breed
    is hard to pinpoint â\x80\x93 clearly they are mixes - we see some lab but not
    sure what else.  Mama Wilmington is a caring and gentle soul, sometimes mildly
    shy at first, but is well mannered and likes to please.  She politely waits for
    direction and guidance from her human then tries her best to please.  She is very
    good with other dogs as well as humans as is Larson but please no cats as they
    don't seem to like them.  She continues to dote on her boy Larson and if Larson
    is with you, you can count on Mama to be close by.  She is content to quietly
    lay in the sun and watch Larson play - she is not as interested in the rough and
    tumble as he is, but she always keeps a watchful eye on him.  Larson will amuse
    you with his clown-like antics while he runs about and plays.  We approximate
    Wilmington to have been born around 2010 and Larson 2014. Both are around 45 lbs.
    \ Whoever adopts these two will fall in love with them.  If you are that special
    someone who will open up your hearts to this mom and son, then please contact
    us promptly as they are so deserving of a loving home that we want nothing more
    for them than to have that.  Please contact RickyC68@aol.com and please include
    a phone number where you can be reached.  Wilmington and Larson are anxiously
    awaiting your call.  Thank you."

- :name: JUNE
  :size: large
  :description: |-
    June came to us as a stray after having been picked up roaming loose by the authorities.  She is a very good girl but also a very strong girl possessing lots of energy.  She handles and minds well, but she doesn't get along well at all with most other dogs.  June needs to go to an adult only home with no small children or cats and no other dogs, unless she is introduced to them beforehand and gives her approval.  She also needs an inside home with a secure fenced yard to exercise in.

    NOTE:  MUST LIVE WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 100 RADIUS TO ADOPT
