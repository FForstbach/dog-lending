  description: "Thank you for your interest in our Bulldogs! \n\nWe have more than
    40 dogs in need of homes. They all reside in private, loving foster homes throughout
    the Dallas/Fort Worth area. We don't have one facility. \n\nAll of our dogs are
    neutered/spayed and up-to-date on their vaccinations and health care prior to
    adoption. Our adoption fees typically range $400-600. The variance is based on
    the dogs' ages, medical needs, etc. \n\nIf you are interested in adoption, you
    must first fill out an adoption application, which can be found on our Web site,
    http://dfwbulldogrescue.org/forms/adoption-application/ Please follow the directions
    to submit the application fee as well. \n\nIt would be best to apply when your
    entire family is fully ready to adopt and after you are in a stable living environment.
    The person who will be the main caretaker of the dog needs to be the one to fill
    out the application.\n\nThe application lets us know what you're looking for and
    we, in turn, can look for the best match for you, if you are approved. Only one
    application is needed because we match approved families to the right dogs for
    them. We take great pride in our match-making skills.\n\nIf the application receives
    an initial OK by the application review committee, we then do a vet check, a landlord
    check, a phone interview(s), a home visit and then, lastly, coordinate a meet-and-greet
    (if feasible) to determine if the dog we have in mind for you is a perfect match
    for your family. All of these steps are part of our stringent approval process.
    \n\nIt's difficult to tell you how quickly it will take us to get through the
    steps detailed above, as we are a volunteer-driven non-profit and all our rescue
    work is done during our \"off\" time (after work, families and our own dogs are
    handled). Plus, our goal is to match the BEST families to our dogs, so that may
    require some time for us to find that \"best buddy.\" In many cases, we have approved
    families ready and waiting for when their perfect match arrives.\n\nPlease keep
    in mind that the Web site (or Petfinder page) doesn't always feature ALL of our
    dogs. Due to the number of surrenders and shelter pulls we handle, our number
    of available Bulldogs changes frequently. You may also want to keep an eye on
    our Facebook page, as we try to keep that fresh with content, pics, etc.\n\nWe
    have some dogs that are in our program for two weeks; some may be with us for
    a year. It's all about finding them the most perfect families possible.\n\nThis
    is required reading prior to applying: http://bit.ly/2dyiS5v\n\nThank you! \nLone

    they are clearly seniors.  These two lovely housetrained ladies love to go for
    walks and ride in the car well also.  LadyBug and Chula ended up in rescue because
    their dad was a veteran with PTSD, and he recently passed away.  In gratitude
    for his service, our rescue took them in, to find them a place to be loved for
    the rest of their lives.  As far as we can tell, they have no poor behaviors and
    are healthy. Chula had a dental on Feb 22,2017.  Neither is a barker, and they
    sleep in beds next to yours, or on the bed with you, whichever you prefer.  They
    come together, since they are bonded, with a total fee of $150.  They are both

  description: "Zade is a 3 year old German Shepherd who weighs in at a light 80 lbs.
    He is in need of a new home; foster or permanent. He is obedience trained and
    knows his commands. He walks great on a leash and enjoys  1- 1 Â½ miles walks
    a few times a week.  He gets along with other dogs and with cats who are comfortable
    being around dogs.  We were told he is good with children, but have not seen him
    around toddlers or young children.  We recommend that children be school age or
    teens, so there is no hair pulling or stumbling on him. He has not been well socialized
    and does not trust strangers, so he is scheduled for training to learn to accept
    people and become comfortable around people he doesn't know.  Zade is neutered,
    current on vaccinations and heartworm negative.  He has not been crated since
    he was a puppy, but is not a chewer and has not been destructive in the home.
    Zade will be getting refresher crate training along with his new social skills.
    He enjoys going for car rides, playing with his toys and being in the company
    of his family.  His favorite game to play is Frisbee and he is very good about
    bringing it back for another throw. Zadeâ\x80\x99s ideal home would be with an
    active family who will take him for walks/ runs and play fetch with him. His new
    family must also follow through with his training protocol to ensure that he behaves
    well around strangers. He will be protective of his family, but must not decide
    on his own if they need protecting. We would like him go to a home with a fenced
    yard.\n\nNote: Zade was recently treated for a hematoma in his left ear, so at
    least for now, that ear flops over.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Zane,

    spayed or neutered, and microchipped. They are fostered in homes so that we can
    tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior,
    whether they get along with other dogs, if they are crate trained, if they are
    leash trained and house trained. Our volunteers do not have cats, so we cannot
    tell you whether our dogs get along with cats.\n\nWe show our animals at Petsmart
    at Grant & Swan in Tucson most Saturdays from 12:00pm to 3:30pm. We are set up
    in the back of the store. \n\nThank you for considering a rescue as your new family
    member!"

    together their whole lives.Their owner died sadly and they stayed by her side
    until her family discovered she had passed away. Jenny is very, very sweet and
    sadly will need surgery for bladder stones once the infection is cleared up.  JB
    is a total love bug. He is a bit overweight and has some orthopedic issues. At
    some point in his life, JB's front leg was fractured but he never received the
    necessary vet care. The leg has healed a bit crooked but is not causing him any
    pain. He will, however have surgery on both of his knees to help improve his ability
    to ambulate. They are crate trained but do not know much about walking on leashes.
    JB and Jenny are VERY BONDED and will need to be adopted together. They both love
    to snuggle with their human. \n\n\nAdoption application, home visit and adoption

    side that makes training her a breeze, and an equally energetic, silly side that's
    always up for some fun!   She makes a fantastic running/walking partner and never
    turns down the chance to run around and be a goofball in the yard. She is learning
    what toys are and is fascinated with them. Ria loves to learn and picks up training
    in a flash. She thrives on knowing what is expected of her and hearing that she
    is a \"good girl\". She is a young girl still at about 1-2 years old so she's
    got energy to burn but she works hard to remember her manners in the house. She
    is working on her housetraining and picking it up quickly. She crates for the
    workday though is an expert Houdini at escaping the typical wire/plastic crates
    so needs a reinforced crate. Ria is excellent with other dogs but needs a home
    without cats (they're far too fun to chase!). She would love an active home who
    wants a dog to take with on all their adventures.  \n\nRequirements: No cats\n\nYou

    She responds to us as her caretakers very well, but she definitely has a fear

    have a general idea. We are working with her to help her overcome her fears, but
    until then, she is only available to a home who is qualified to help her through

    spay and rabies. If you would like to meet Peggy Sue to see if she approves you

    Hello everyone! My name is Lucie and I am a 6 year old Rottweiler Lab mix weighing 75 pounds! I have been at the sanctuary for almost 2.5 years now awaiting the perfect family! I am an excellent guard dog, always alerting the staff and volunteers of new faces and the occasional squirrel! It doesn't take very much to tire me out; a 10 minute walk or a short game of fetch is exactly what I need! I am the perfect dog to enjoy a glass of wine and a movie with! I really love extra treats especially a purple popsicle or a fresh carrot! I am extremely loyal to those that I have come to love and will always keep them safe. I would do best in a home with tenured dog owners and I prefer to be the only animal there. I would do better in a home with no smaller children but would be fine with children of an older age. A little patiences and dedication and I will truly be someones best friend and forever companion.

    Lucie is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, heart worm negative, and has been spayed.

    The cost to adopt Lucie is $175 and the adoption process begins with an Adoption Application that can be found on our website under the printable forms tab: www.faithfulfriendsnc.org

    2016, as a humane case, through the Trumbull County Animal Cruelty Task Force.
    Santana was living outdoors with absolute neglect.  The owners did not even acknowledge
    that a dog was living outside. He was  emaciated, full of infection on his skin,
    eyes and ears. He was also heartworm positive. Santana had no access to food or
    freshwaterâ\x80¦ his water bucket was green with algae growth. \n After all Santana
    has been through, he still loves and trusts people, and is so excited to meet
    a new friend! He has spent several months in boarding awaiting a rescue to take
    him on for adoption. During his boarding, he was neutered, up-to-date with all
    of his shots, and heartworm treated!  He put on some good weight and is healthy
    as can be now. \nSouth Hills Pet Rescue and Resort, outside of Pittsburgh, agreed
    to take in Santana to help him find all that he deserves.  He deserves a family
    of his own where he can be a real dog, cuddled up on a comfy couch. Each spot
    in his journey is a stepping stone to get him right where he needs to be.\n Part
    of his journey was being chosen by the Pittsburgh Aviation Animal Rescue Transport
    team as their 5000th rescue passenger! They picked him up  at the Youngstown airport
    and flew him to South Hills Rescue! It was  quite an exciting day for all of us
    involved.  Lots of happy tears as we watched Santana fly off. \nCurrently, Santana
    is waiting at South Hills with quite a story to tell. Will you be the one with
    whom he can share the happy ending? \nSantana is fine with other dogs, he is a
    happy soul in really just wants to be near you and loved on.  He is up-to-date

    lbs. She's an all-around great dog! \n\nThis beauty loves to run and play with
    the other dogs. Her favorite buddy is a 13 lb terrier girl who loves to play chase
    with Arya..\n\nArya is spayed, HW negative and on preventatives, She is housebroken
    and crate trained. She's great with small dogs and submissive large dogs as well.
    She hasn't been tested with cats. \n\nArya came to rescue due to being too large
    and clumsy for a home with a toddler. There was no aggression what so ever - she
    loves people, big and small. She's just a typical clutzy mastiff, We would be
    willing to consider adopting her to a Mastiff experienced family with a dog savvy

    medically and financially. \n \n Medical Needs: Requires Dental, has Sever Luxating
    Patellas, Hip Issues. May be older than initial exams. Will available. \n \n To

    \n The album will contain the dogs which are available for adoption from the puppy
    mill. Information on each individual dog will be posted under their photo INCLUDING
    follow up medical care that IS necessary. Adopters PLEASE note that these dogs
    came from terrible conditions in which they rarely received care and will require
    follow up. Each post will tell you what \"POD\" the dog is in by color code: Green
    (friendly) Yellow (behavioral/socialization issues) Red (Severe behavioral/Socialization/
    medical issues). We will be starting with our vetted \"Green\" dogs and add from
    there. \n \n Please note: Adoptions will not necessarily be based on a first come
    first served basis. Please submit an application for the dog you are interested
    in adopting and one of our volunteers will return contact with you. These dogs
    have been through so much in their lives, and it's important to find their perfect
    match. \n \n Please make sure to review the adoption application and guidelines
    here: https://form.jotform.us/ 71243641222142\n \n Like we have advised previously,
    we only retained approximately 40 dogs for adoption through our agency. As additional
    dogs are vetted and socialized better, we will add their photos to this album.
    Additional agencies which have dogs for adoption are the following: \n \n Angels
    of Assisi\n Angels Among Us\n Cashiers Highlands Humane Society\n Humane Society
    of Northeast Georgia\n Humane Educational Society \n McKamey Animal Center\n Nashville
    Humane Association\n PAWS of Bryson City\n \n It was impossible for our agency
    to financially and physically to support all the animals to say with our agency.
    Volunteers are tending to the daily care of the retained animals.\n \n Again,
    please understand that most of these dogs are not going to be the perfect pet
    right off the bat. They will require extensive follow up veterinary care, socialization,
    training, etc. Many will most likely not do well in a home with children. Puppy
    mills are not full of rolly polly healthy puppies. Puppies are sold as fast as
    possible, and the dogs that remain there as breeders are in horrific conditions,
    with untreated medical issues and left without human contact.\n Please consider
    checking out some our current adoptable animals at the â\x80\x9Cregularâ\x80\x9D
    shelter that have nobody wanting them-the forgotten and abandoned animals needing
    homes desperately!   \n\n   \n\n \n\n\n\nThe adoption fee for all animals, adopted
    from the Habersham County Animal Shelter, is $110. The price of the adoption includes:\n\n
    Dogs: spay or neuter, microchip and registration, rabies vaccination, DHLPP vaccination,
    Bordatella vaccination, SNAP Heartworm Test, deworming and one month of complimentary,
    catastrophic, insurance.\n\n Cats: spay or neuter, microchip and registration,
    rabies vaccination, FVRCP vaccination, FeLV/FIV Combo Test, deworming and one
    month of complimentary, catastrophic, insurance.\n\n We invite you to come see
    all our adoptable pets here at the shelter! HCACC will often have more animals
    in house than posted online. If you don't see what you're looking for here, please
    contact us or come visit!\n\n We are proud of our new 'Play Area' for the Dogs!
    We encourage adopters to bring their current dogs if looking to add a new fur-member
    to their family so we can help you pick the right new pet for everyone in the
    household! Dogs can now interact with potential family members off leash in our
    'Adoption Pavilion'!\n\n Check us out on Facebook! \n\n https://www.facebook.com/HabershamShelterUrgentFurkids/"

- name: Jarvis
  size: medium
  description: "CBR is a volunteer run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization serving North
    and South Carolina. Our Boxers come to us from shelters, humane societies and
    directly from owners. They enter into volunteer foster homes throughout both states
    and live indoors with the foster family and other pets. Each Boxer receives a
    complete physical, immunizations, sterilization, heartworm test and treatment
    for any illnesses or diseases. We evaluate temperament to ensure that each Boxer
    we rescue will make a good family pet. These evaluations are achieved through
    living with the dog and watching him/her interact with children, adults and other
    pets. All of our Boxers are tested for aggression issues and any other behavior
    problems. Each dog learns basic house manners and is crate and house trained.
    We do not accept nor place dogs with known human aggression issues.\n\n\n\n~~Hi
    there...it's me Jarvis. I am new here and thought I would tell you about myself.
    First the good things..I love to play fetch, snuggle on the couch and I sleep
    in the bed with my humans. I have only had a little accident in the house (hey
    I was excited) and I will let you know I need to go out.\n\n Now the not so good....I
    need someone that will love me and have patience with me. Foster mom says I need
    someone to take time with me and train me not to jump when I get excited and see
    someone new. I have not had that in my life and I now have some separation anxiety.
    I also get too attached to my people...so attached I don't want any other dogs
    or peoples to get close to my peoples, I think they are all mine.\n\n Foster mom
    also told me to say I would be best in a home with no other animals...fish, birds,
    cats and other dogs....no one ever taught me they aren't to be played with, so
    I would do best as an only animal in the house...even though I keep telling her
    I am not an animal..\n\n Ok, I am going to let foster mom talk now. Jarvis would
    be a wonderful companion to anyone that is familiar with the boxer breed...that
    knows how intelligent and stubborn they are. Jarvis deserves someone to love and
    train him to help him be the great companion he can be.\n\n Update 10/8 \n\n Foster
    Dad here, Jarvis has been getting much better with his manners like jumping on
    guests, snipping at his older foster sister. Learning to heal on walks, but this
    takes a firm person walking him to help him learn. He also knows his basic commands
    including some fun ones as shake. He is good at meal time sitting at edge of kitchen
    waiting for the command that his food is ready.\n\n He is wanting to learn and
    to please and is very intelligent, just a lot of puppy as most boxers are at his
    age.\n\n As far as having other pets in the house I would still say he will do
    best as a only pet, but will get along and bond with another female dog , older
    would be better , and should be his size or bigger. Our female outweighs him by
    35# and is 6 years older, so she holds her own with him and helps show him how
    to behave.\n\n  He will bond with his new parents especially with the alpha that
    is training him he will constantly follow , sit and snuggle his new trainer as
    he only wants to please and needs someone to help him learn.\n\n  We are both
    enjoying him more each day especially at play time (which is often). Loves to
    play fetch and run outside for his ball and tug of war is one of his favorites.
    He is very active but does enjoy his naps.\n\n  He also enjoys going for rides
    and is very good while in a car.\n\n  We canâ\x80\x99t wait to hear how he is
    doing as he matures and learns with a forever family and home.\n\n Please visit
    Carolina Boxer Rescue for more information on available dogs, adoption policies,
    CBR events!\n\n\n\nAnyone interested in a CBR dog should read our Views and Policies
    and, if in agreement, fill out and submit an application. During the processing
    phase, all references will be checked including vet and landlord (if renting).
    As long as there are no negative references and the application does not contain
    any information contradictory to our policy, a homevisit will then be scheduled.
    After the homevisit, the applicant is either approved to adopt, approved with
    contingencies or denied. At this point, we begin the process of matching your
    family with one of our boxers. Our standard adoption fee is $250.00. Mixes may
    be less and puppies may be more."

    \ \n\nOur adoption process starts with our application. Once the application is
    approved, a member of Legacy will contact you to set up a home visit. The home
    visit usually last 1-11/2 hours and is to make sure our dog and any current dogs/cats
    are getting along, as well as both of us agreeing it's a fit. At this time the
    adoption fee is due, and begins the 2 week trial. We will check in during the
    2 week trial. If it's not working, our dog is returned to the foster home and
    all except $50.00 of the adoption fee is returned. At the end of the 2 week trial,
    you decide if you will finalize the adoption - if finalized, the Adoption Contract
    is signed and all medical records are turned over to you. If at any time you need
    to rehome the dog it contractually needs to be returned to Legacy Dog Rescue.\n\nADOPTION

    time I make a sound.  And I pretty quickly learn how to make my way outside and
    back inside. My foster mom is a little concerned because I sometimes bump into
    things, but thatâ\x80\x99s how I learn. My hearing is not great anymore, and I
    donâ\x80\x99t have many teeth, but not having those teeth doesnâ\x80\x99t stop
    me from eating well. I am already neutered, and I am a world-class sleeper! \n\n
    \   So, what do you say...do you want a cute, loveable, deserving little guy to
    keep you company? Because you can adopt me if you doâ\x80¦and I want to be adopted

    had my back surgery and hope to walk again !!!\n\nIâ\x80\x99m a two year old,
    55 lb border collie/aussie shepherd mix. Not long ago, I was wandering the streets
    and was hit by a car. This happened in Iran, where dogs are considered by most
    people to be impure and no different from any other vermin. So the driver just
    drove away and left me all alone on the side of the road to die. But I didn't.
    Lucky for me there are enough compassionate dog lovers living here and one of
    them found me. I was rescued! Though I had emergency surgery on my spine the use
    of my back legs couldnâ\x80\x99t be saved. The humans at the clinic wanted to
    euthanize me but, lucky for me yet again, my very special rescuer decided I deserved
    to live. But there is nowhere for me to stay permanently in Iran, so here I am,
    looking for a new forever family in Canada. \nDespite my disability I still have
    control of my bladder and bowels and will take myself to a pee pad to do my business
    and then take myself away. Pretty good, right! Because of my disability I will
    need a home with easy access to the outside (or at least an elevator). \nI am
    a very gentle, extremely loving and good-natured boy who is great with other dogs
    and kids and though I donâ\x80\x99t know yet how I might interact with cats, it
    is thought I would be good with them as well, or at the worst have a hard time
    catching one. However I will be getting a wheelchair soon and once I do I will
    be able to run like the wind again. \nI love walks and being outside which I don't
    get to do much in Iran. I hear Vancouver has some great puddles to play in. I
    canâ\x80\x99t wait to try some out. I will be flown to Vancouver as soon as my
    new and very special person applies to foster to adopt me. I promise I will return
    your graciousness and compassion with all the love I have to give. I am neutered,
    microchipped and my vaccinations are up-to-date. My adoption fee is $500"

    Hello everyone! My name is Lucie and I am a 6 year old Rottweiler Lab mix weighing 75 pounds! I have been at the sanctuary for almost 2.5 years now awaiting the perfect family! I am an excellent guard dog, always alerting the staff and volunteers of new faces and the occasional squirrel! It doesn't take very much to tire me out; a 10 minute walk or a short game of fetch is exactly what I need! I am the perfect dog to enjoy a glass of wine and a movie with! I really love extra treats especially a purple popsicle or a fresh carrot! I am extremely loyal to those that I have come to love and will always keep them safe. I would do best in a home with tenured dog owners and I prefer to be the only animal there. I would do better in a home with no smaller children but would be fine with children of an older age. A little patiences and dedication and I will truly be someones best friend and forever companion.

    Lucie is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, heart worm negative, and has been spayed.

    The cost to adopt Lucie is $175 and the adoption process begins with an Adoption Application that can be found on our website under the printable forms tab: www.faithfulfriendsnc.org

    to guide his energy into the polite, easy boy we know he can be. He would do best
    in a home with no other animals.

- name: Ellie
  size: large
  description: "AVAILABLE AFTER FEB 21, 2017\nEllie\n1.5 year old Great Dane\n \nEllie
    arrived into Paws United Dog Rescue after starting her life as a breeding dog.
    \ She had not had the best of care in her short time and arrived to rescue very
    malnourished, timid, nervous and feeling uneasy about everything.  In a short
    time she has flourished and able to finally be the happy goofy gal she has longed
    to be for so long.  During transitional times Ellie will need patience and time
    to adjust.  She is still learning to be confident in new places and with new people
    but has been working to build positive connections and experiences with this while
    in foster care.  Day to day she is just happy go lucky and full of love so sheâ\x80\x99ll
    get there with her confidence in unfamiliar places but all prospective homes should
    be ready to continue this confidence building with her.  Ellie can be a noisy
    gal at times; sheâ\x80\x99s a vocal player, excited barker, alert barker and a
    bit of a chatter.  Weâ\x80\x99d recommend no apartments or attached housing as
    Ellie could upset close Neighbours.  Ellie loves to be close to her humans and
    is usually pressed close to your legs or leaning in for face cuddles whenever
    sheâ\x80\x99s not busy playing.  If youâ\x80\x99ll let her sheâ\x80\x99ll be snuggled
    up on top of you so youâ\x80\x99ll need a big lap and a big couch to keep this
    snuggle bug happy.  She will stay off furniture when asked but of course her love
    of cuddles will keep her wishing for a cozy spot next to you if youâ\x80\x99ll
    let her.  Ellie is very food motivated and eager to please, sheâ\x80\x99ll be
    loving and protective of her family, ready to entertain those around her and gigantic
    playmate whenever opportunity strikes.  If youâ\x80\x99re ready for this kind
    of love in your life hereâ\x80\x99s a little checklist of what Ellie is looking
    for in a forever home;\nEllie will be looking for a forever family with Great
    Dane experience as well as experience working on confidence building alongside
    some basic training. \nDue to her tendency to spook in busy loud situations we
    are looking for a child free home at this time.  \nShe has also shown herself
    to be a little too excited about feline friends so for their sake, Cat free homes
    only please.  \nEllie will enjoy a fellow dog in a forever family however this
    is not a must.  Playmates should be comfortable with BIG CLUMBSY friends as Ellie
    is a very rambunctious playmate and doesnâ\x80\x99t understand her size.  \nShe
    LOVES going on walks in the nature trails each day and will want a family able
    to get her out for a daily walk.  \nShe will also require a fenced in yard to
    stretch her legs and do her business off leash. \nDetached housing only please.
    She will need continued LEASH training. Ellie is crate trained, house trained
    and knows basicâ\x80\x99s such as sit, come, leave it .\nEllie has been vaccinated,
    microchipped, dewormed, heartworm tested, spayed, and treated with Advantage.
    \n\nThe adoption fee is $325 and includes spay/neuter (dogs over 6 months), vaccines,
    heartworm test (dogs over 6 months) and microchip. Please visit www.paws-united.com
    to fill out an application.\n**For puppies under 6 months a $100 spay/neuter rebate
    will be given if they are not spayed/neutered before adoption.**"

    Great manners...check. I could go on and on about this guy! \n\n  \n\n Theon has
    been with us a couple of days now and we can't quit talking about how well-behaved
    he is for a big puppy. He is potty trained, crate trained, and doesn't jump up
    on people. He is the definition of sweet and seems to be a bit of a sensitive
    guy. He gets along well with all people, dogs of any size, and I'm told also does
    well with cats that are used to being around dogs. I wouldn't consider Theon a
    high energy dog but he does enjoy romping around the backyard with the other dogs
    and walks/jogs around the neighborhood. So far he doesn't seem that interested
    in playing with toys but does enjoy chewing on bones and getting loved on by people.
    \ \n\n You will not be sorry adding this guy to your family. He does request a
    family that is as into cuddle sessions as he is!\n\n  \n\n\n\nTo view additional

- name: Porscha
  size: small
  description: "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nMeet
    Porscha, the sweetest senior girl you will ever meet! Porscha was saved from a
    high kill shelter after her owner abandoned her there. This beautiful girl is
    estimated at 12 years old and weighs 9 pounds. She is house trained, leash trained,
    crate trained, and will do anything for a treat! Porscha does have only a few
    front teeth left and an old jaw fracture that makes it a task for her to eat.
    She does well with soft food that is broken up into smaller pieces and LOVES her
    food. This poor girl also has a collapsed disc in her back, but it does not cause
    her too much trouble as long as she is maintained on Metacam. Besides these minor
    issues, Porscha is healthy overall. Porscha just needs a retirement home where
    she can coexist. She does not like sleeping in bed and will try to jump out so
    we have been doing daily sessions of taking her to bed for a few minutes and loving
    on her, but she still likes to be on the floor or in her crate. She seeks out
    the man of the house for attention and enjoys being carried around and getting
    rubs. She does like the female of the home, but she really lights up when her
    foster dad comes home from work. This senior girl has lots of pep left in her
    and even runs around the yard or runs through the house when food is involved.
    She needs a calm home that will be mindful of her to ensure she does not jump
    down or fall. \n\n To adopt Porscha, please submit an application at PomPaws.org.
    Her $250 adoption fee ($150 for senior citizens 65+) includes core vaccines (rabies,
    distemper/parvo, and bordatella), spay, fecal, heartworm/lyme test, microchip,
    blood work, dental cleaning, and all the love you can handle."

  description: |-
    Please contact Anne at (731) 332-9116 for more information about this pet.
    Buster is a brindle retriever/pit bull mix with white markings.  He weighs approximately 65 pounds.  He was found in the median of a busy highway along with his female companion, Flossie.  (She is pictured with Buster in the third photograph.)  Both dogs were emaciated, scavenging for food, and dodging traffic.  Buster is now a healthy, energetic, athlete of a dog.  He has shown aggression toward some dogs, some people, and ALL cats.  He needs an experienced dog person and a secure fence with plenty of room to run.  He's a superb swimmer, so he also needs access to a swimming pool, pond, or lake.  If you have a place for Buster, he could easily become the most 'fun' dog you have ever known.  His favorite game is 'Oh, boy!  Someone left the truck windows down.  Wanna chase each other through them?'  He is beautiful, graceful, goofy, and sweet.  He loves life.  His antics will make you laugh.  His loyalty will make you cry.  If you deserve a dog like Buster, please visit him at Red Fern.
    Buster's adoption fee is $200.00. If you are interested in adopting please visit .redfern.petfinder.com and submit an application.  Thank you!

    is clearly afraid of other dogs and is under-socialized. She tends to bark and
    lunge at other dogs when on leash, but is happy to meet them off leash. Once she
    knows the other dog is \"safe\" she is happy to socialize and interact. Dog parks
    are not a good option for her at this time. \n\n  Montana has quickly adjusted
    to her new surroundings and is coming out of her shell more and more each day.
    Montana should be the only dog in the household but she would love to live with

- name: Lizzy
  size: medium
  description: |-
    CBR is a volunteer run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization serving North and South Carolina. Our Boxers come to us from shelters, humane societies and directly from owners. They enter into volunteer foster homes throughout both states and live indoors with the foster family and other pets. Each Boxer receives a complete physical, immunizations, sterilization, heartworm test and treatment for any illnesses or diseases. We evaluate temperament to ensure that each Boxer we rescue will make a good family pet. These evaluations are achieved through living with the dog and watching him/her interact with children, adults and other pets. All of our Boxers are tested for aggression issues and any other behavior problems. Each dog learns basic house manners and is crate and house trained. We do not accept nor place dogs with known human aggression issues.



    ~~Lizzy is doing great! She's been out of the shelter for two and a half weeks. She's really blossoming with positive attention and a safe space to hang out in.

     She loves to go for walks with the family. She's met lots of people and is so cute and sweet when she says hello. Inside the house she loves to snuggle on the couch.

     At this time, Lizzy needs a bit of space when she eats. She's really nice when we give her treats though.

     Lizzy is great with people. She's great with dogs with a slow introduction. This is a super sweet girl who will be an awesome family member.

     Please visit Carolina Boxer Rescue for more information on available dogs, adoption policies, CBR events!



    Anyone interested in a CBR dog should read our Views and Policies and, if in agreement, fill out and submit an application. During the processing phase, all references will be checked including vet and landlord (if renting). As long as there are no negative references and the application does not contain any information contradictory to our policy, a homevisit will then be scheduled. After the homevisit, the applicant is either approved to adopt, approved with contingencies or denied. At this point, we begin the process of matching your family with one of our boxers. Our standard adoption fee is $250.00. Mixes may be less and puppies may be more.

  description: |-
    Dogs: Yes (must be tolerant of vocal playing dogs)
    Cats: No!
    Kids: No, older teens would be fine.
    Attached housing: Maybe- is vocal at first while crated but will settle.


    Our princess is now looking for her very own fairytale happy ending.

    Meet Blanca (aka Snow White)! This girl had a not so happy beginning when she came into our care. She was plagued with skin issues and itchy allergies. We are happy to say that these have cleared up while she went through princess camp and are now under control. Blanca does need a daily medication and a prescription food to help with her terrible allergies. She also has a medicated shampoo that is encouraged for her as well.

    Blanca enjoys longer walks in the morning so that she is tired when you crate her before leaving for the day. A princess needs her people around her more that usual, so Blanca is looking for people that are home more often than not. If you work from home, Blanca is your gal. She's happy to be in the same room as you, but isn't always seeking affection.

    Blanca likes to play with other dogs, but is a bit vocal. (She likes to boss her subjects around!) She is housetrained, crate trained, and knows several commands. Blanca does need to have boundaries laid out for her and ongoing consistent training is a must, otherwise she becomes a spoiled princess. Blanca has lots of energy, so runs and bike rides are her favourites.

    Blanca's castle should come with a fully fenced yard and no kids. If you have room in your castle for a snowy white princess, send an email to adopt@sitwithme.ca for an application!

  description: "Rocko is a 2 year old and 10 lb sweet and loyal dog. He gets along
    great with other dogs. He loves long walks and is very curious and full of energy.
    You will fall in love the moment you meet him.  \n\n  From his foster mom:  \n\n
    Rocko needs a lot of attention, looks like nobody ever had played with him before.
    He doesn't know how to fetch. I would love for him a loving family that goes out
    with him to dog parks and take him on vacation too, like a family member. He was
    very anxious at the beginning, now that I earned his trust, I don't want him to
    get disappointed again. \n\n    I fostered Rocko to notice that he was acting
    like a dog that had been mistreated by their prior owners before he was rescued.
    He seemed very scared and traumatized, getting stressed by every little noise
    and sudden movements of human beings around him, like if he had been physically
    punished before in the past. I also noticed that he was very anxious and nervous
    of small places, like a puppy that has been locked for long periods of time during
    his first two years of life.  \n \n Therefore, his new owner should be very loving
    and sensitive with a dog that has recently learned to trust people because it
    took a lot of work, patience, love, and time. \n \n Evidently, this is a dog that
    has lots of love to give in return, he gets attached easily and would be all over
    you, waiting for you at all times and making you happy, as long as you give him
    the love, space, time, and respect that every dog deserves.   \n\n   Adoption
    fee is $250 and includes DHPP & rabies vaccinations, heartworm testing, spay/neuter
    surgery, deworming, and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian.
